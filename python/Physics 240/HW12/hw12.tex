\section{Introduction}
The purpose of this exercise to use Newton's method of root finding to find the values for E of a particle in a finite square well. The system is given in 2 functions:\\
\begin{center}
$\sqrt{-E} = \sqrt{E-V}tan(\frac{a}{h}\sqrt{2m(E-V})$ for the even function and \\

$\sqrt{-E} = -\sqrt{E-V}cotan(\frac{a}{h}\sqrt{2m(E-V})$ for the odd function
\end{center}
\indent What I did was using the sympy library to define a function f(E) and then use the diff function to compute f'(E) and then apply Newton method.
\section{Discussion}
I tested my function with an example of finding the root for $\sqrt{612}$ and the Newton's method implementation works. However, when I applied it to the even and odd energy function, I get some really strange answers involve i and the values doesn't seem to converge, it changes depends on my initial guess of E and I tried many different values. Everything computed except I could not plot because the i in the answers. At this point this is the best I can do because I don't know what's wrong with my function.
