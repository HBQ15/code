\section{Introduction}
This is an exercise to simulate the motion of an electron with the present of a uniform Electric field and Magnetic field, both are perpendicular to each other. We apply the Lorentz force law $F = q*(E + v \times$B) and at the end we compute the drift velocity $U_{drift}$ = $E \times B$ / $B^2$

\noindent The values I computed for the drift velocity is 27.8 m/s, whereas the theoretica value is 25 m/s, which I think is not so far off.
