\title{Homework 22 - Physics 240\\
		Romberg integration}

\section{Introduction}
The goal of this homework is to numerical integration to evaulate an integral. In this homework we use the Romberg integration

\section{Discussion and answer}
Originally the code provided didn't work for me, since the hstack and vstack ran into the issue of the array not being the same size, and I could not understand the logic of doing hstack after the vstack. So I modified the code to run a specific number of steps instead, then compute the error relative to the tolerance indepedently. So for the function I = $\frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}\int_0^1e^{-x^2}dx$, the answer I got with 14 iterations is 0.84270079 and the error is 2.29380266458e-10 \\
The full Romberg table can be seen when run the program, note that the process takes quite a bit of time(approximately 1 minute or more) when the number of steps is more than 22. I could not get the values to be on a diagonal, it could because I did not stack them properly. When I have the time I would fix that, but I can't do that now\\
Compared to the numpy.romberg() function, which gives the answer of 0.84270079295 after 33 interations, I say my code is pretty good for the tolerance value and and the error it gives.

e) Value: 0\\
f) Value: I don't know how to put this into Python\\
** Because of time constrain I could not figure out the stacking to make the Romberg table to look nicer. I will work on it when I have time.
